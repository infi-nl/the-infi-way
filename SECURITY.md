# Security Policy

Since there are nearly no development dependencies, and no code is run for users, we have no heavy weight security policy.
In the off case you do find a security vulnerability:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/infi-nl/the-infi-way/issues) for most cases;
- E-mail `jeroen [at] infi [dot] nl` in case it would not be responsible to publicly open an issue;

Note that for [content of The Infi Way](https://github.com/infi-nl/the-infi-way/tree/main/content) regarding the topic of Security, we recommend using the same approach as for all other content.
